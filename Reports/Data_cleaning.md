This is a report on the missing values of the *Ride table* and how I handled them:
\
\
**There are 4 types of trips that miss values.**\
In total there are **71 115 trips** that have missing values in one of the fields following: **endstationname, startstationname, endtime, starttime.**
There are trips that:
1. don't have endstationname nor endtime (60 778)
2. don't have endstationname (6 397)
3. don't have startstationname(3 698)
4. don't have startstationname nor endstationname (282)
